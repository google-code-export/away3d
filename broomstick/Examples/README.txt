The contents of this folder are very crude examples and tests that we use while
developing the engine. They are not very well documented, and should not be
regarded as anything even remotely similar to tutorials or teaching material.

You are welcome to look around and play with the code, but since this is alpha
software, we cannot guarantee that the examples in this folder will work as 
expected. 

As we get closer to a final release of Away3D 4.0 we will improve all the 
documentation, examples and tutorials, but for now our main concern is to work
on the engine and to continue to give you free and early access to the best
open-source 3D engine for Flash!

Thanks for your patience

/The Away3D team.
